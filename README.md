# Weather_Data_Analytics
A Python project that fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and performs data analysis. It uses matplotlib for data visualization, pandas for data handling, and psycopg2 to interact with the PostgreSQL database. The project also saves weather data to a CSV file for reporting and analysis.
